# Progetto Terminali Mobili - Visita Museale PAUN (Parco Archeologico Urbano Napoli)

A didaptical project in collaboration with University of Naples Parthenope created by <b>Casolaro Angelo</b> and <b>Iannuzzo Gennaro</b>

The aim of the project is to give the user the possibility to make a museum visit in virtual reality. The user has the possibility to interact with some elements inside the museum and to make the visit with other users.

The client/server architecture consists of clients that are represented by users using the application with devices like Cardboard, Oculus Go, Oculus Quest, and others and an amazon server via AWS service.

From the software point of view, the server in question uses the runtime node.js, to execute JavaScript code side server and manage the multiplayer. Clients and servers exchange JSON files for runtime updates about the location of different users and other types of information.
